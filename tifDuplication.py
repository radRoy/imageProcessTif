"""
This file is for formatting hdf5 files the right way, so that 3D U-Net can handle the multi-channel images.
Fiji's default is to save RGB images in the order zyxC, but U-Net takes multi-channel input as Czyx.

This script is for creating duplicate arrays of the (label) tif image data, then saving that to Czyx formatted tif.
Since fiji forces 16bit grey scale data into 8bit per channel data when converting to RGB, I have to do this in python,
because, apparently, 3d unet wants the label data (in the given hdf5's /label path) in uint16 format.
3dunet also wants one target channel per input channel, i.e., if there are 4 input channels and the same
solution (label) for all of them, 3dunet wants a C=4,Z,Y,X formatted target data set.

This can only be achieved in python (i.e., not in Fiji, or at least not in .ijm macros).
