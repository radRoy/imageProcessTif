open fiji

open the raw image data (tiff stack)
duplicate it
	threshold B&W otsu, min 2000
	apply threshold without change between slices
	save as > tiff of the threshold image, same name as raw data, with a SUFFIX (not prefix) (only matters to aesthetics in file explorers)

select raw data window
save as > HDF5 new (creating a new hdf5 hyperstack)
	choose a filename identical to the raw image data filename, with some suffix like "-labelled"
		choose "Standard (no time)" for convenience (each added 3D stack is essentially one recorded fluorescence channel, to the hdf5 format at least)
		specify something like "raw" in the %c text field
		save it
		(wait for completion)

select next image window (i.e., threshold binary image)
save as > HDF5 append
	select just created .h5 file
		do the same as when creating the .h5 file, but change the %c text field accordingly ("threshold" instead of "raw" or whatever)
		save it
		(wait for completion)

opening .h5 files:

file > load hdf5
	...just read it, self-evident, really.
